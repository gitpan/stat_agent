README
    This script can be used as a replacement of the original dim_STAT
    STATsrv monitoring agent.

DESCRIPTION
    This script opens the specified TCP port and waits for connections of
    the dim_STAT server.

    This script was tested with dim_STAT Version 8.2.

    Improvements:

    * Platform independent
      Should run under all UNIX/Linux systems.

    * More restricted security behavior

      - The access file is checked if specified command is executable
         (if not it's not added to the executable command stack).

      - All special characters in the command parameter are deleted
         (except '_', '/', '-' and ' ').

      - It's possible specify a user for each executable command.

    The options are as follows:

    "--port, -p"
                TCP port (default 5000)

    "--file, -f"
                Command access file with the usually STATsrv syntax, e.g.:

                  # Usable from any hosts
                  command  vmstat      /usr/bin/vmstat    
                  # Usable from .50 and .51 only 
                  access 10.10.10.50
                  access 10.10.10.51
                  command  mpstat      /usr/bin/mpstat    
                  command  netstat     /usr/bin/netstat   

                To execute a command by a specific user the following syntax
                has to be used:

                  command  jack:netstat   /usr/bin/netstat    
                  command  jane:mpstat    /usr/bin/mpstat

                To do so the current user must be allowed to "su" to the
                specified user without a password.

    "--daemon, -d"
                Run program as unix daemon

    "--log, -l" Specifies the log file (default STDOUT)

    "--verbose, -v"
                Verbose mode

INSTALLATION
    To replace the existing STATsrv agent with this version shutdown all
    running STATsrv agents and copy the stat-agent.pl script to your STATsrv
    installation:

      /etc/STATsrv/STAT-service stop
      cp stat-agent.pl /etc/STATsrv/bin

    Replace the old STAT-service script with this one:

      cp STAT-service /etc/STATsrv
